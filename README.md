## Reasons for Development
I wanted to build a small app around a logic problem that I already knew how to solve so that I could focus most of my attention on reestablishing my React workflow, learning how to use Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion as my primary styling and animation tools, and developing with a beautiful user experience in mind. 

I wanted to create a mobile first user interface that was clean and that provided most of its user feedback and input validation through the interactivity of the components themselves rather than through alerts or modals. I also wanted to offer the user the option to toggle between light and dark themes in a way that would persist from visit to visit. I tried to looks at my decisions through the perspective of a user and imagine what types of functionality I would assume the app would offer based on the layout and style of the user interface.
