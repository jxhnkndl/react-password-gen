## Reasons for Development
I chose to build a small app based on a logic problem that I already had a strong understanding of how to solve so that I could focus on refreshing my React workflow, practice using Tailwind CSS as my primary styling tool, and learn how to apply simple animations to React components using Framer Motion. The primary goal with this app was to take a simple concept and create as complete and elegant a user experience as possible. I think that I succeeded in avoiding unnecessary alert boxes or modals by incorporating input validation directly into the form components through styling and disabling/enabling buttons. I also really enjoyed the challenge of figuring out how to implement basic component animations and a simple light/dark mode theme to enhance the overall user experience.
